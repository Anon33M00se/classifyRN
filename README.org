#+TITLE: Classification with Torch Vision ResNet and pre-trained Weights

Just a simple bit of code that classifies an imagee using torchvision's
pre-trained weights for the ResNet model.

There's no fxn decoration here (yet), just python. But images are
preprocessed explicitly to the correct size/format/weight without
calling the model's transforms() method.
