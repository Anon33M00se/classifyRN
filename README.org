#+TITLE: Classification with ResNet

Just a simple bit of code that classifies an ime using torchvision's
pre-trained weights for the ResNet model.

There's no fxn decortation here, just python. But images are
preprocessed explicitly to the correct size/format/weight without
calling the model's transforms() method.
